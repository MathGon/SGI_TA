# Analysis

Protein sequences of S025 and S026, with GenBank accession numbers ACS32052 and ACS32053 respectively, where used as tblastn queries to search for similar sequences in GenBank. Homologous protein sequences where retrieved with genome id, coordinates and taxonomic unit. Homologous proteins from a same genome and distant of less than 1kb where conserved for further analysis. To classify the genomic region encoding couples of SgiAT homologous proteins, sequence header was analyzed for the presence of the word “plasmid” and 30 kb surrounding regions were analyzed for the presence of genomic island related genes. Sequences were aligned with clustalo and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed by phyML under a LG model with optimal tree structure from the best of NNI and SPR. 

In accordance with a reproducible research approach, this repository centralizes data, python scripts and figures submitted with the publication.
